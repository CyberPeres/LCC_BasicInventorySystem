Project Purpose
	Develop a simple application to manage a list of products in an inventory using C# or JavaScript. The application should demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, data handling, and basic search/filter functionality.

Technologies Used
ASP.Net / Razor Pages
Why I chose ASP.Net / Razor Pages, I have been Learning Razor wanted to see what I could do with it feels cleaner and more modern. Wanted to try a whole app. Not something I work every day in, stepped out of my comfort zone here on purpose. 
Azure/Azure DevOps â€“ decided to make this a complete process from coding to deployment, Handled by rudimentary source control/deployment so I grabbed my Azure account that I was studying automated testing on and created a complete albeit basic solution to demonstrate my skills in Agile Development & Continuous Integration concepts.
Notes
Grid is not clickable in this version, I would bring out revisions/improvements as needed on a real project, and early/beta versions would meet requirements based on time pressures, need, and other factos.
Persisting data (Database) not provided in this sample, due to my hosting limitations. Of course in the work environment this would be included.
